								<h5 class="card-text">The Problem</h5>
								<p class="card-text">
								Market basket analysis helps to solve the problem of understanding customers' purchasing behavior and uncovering patterns and associations in their shopping habits. By analyzing transaction data and identifying which products tend to be purchased together, businesses can gain insights into the preferences and needs of their customers. This information can be used to improve product recommendations, optimize store layouts, and develop targeted marketing campaigns.
								<br><br>
								Market basket analysis can also be used to identify cross-selling opportunities, which can help increase sales and revenue. For example, if customers who purchase a particular product also tend to buy a complementary product, businesses can promote the complementary product to increase sales.
								<br><br>
								Overall, market basket analysis helps businesses to better understand their customers and make data-driven decisions that improve business outcomes.

								<h5 class="card-text">Cross Selling</h5>
								The cross selling is the ability to sell more products to a customer by analyzing the customer's shopping trends as well as general shopping trends and patterns which are in common with the customer's shopping patterns. More often than not, these recommended products would be very appealing. The retailer will often offer you a bundle of products with some attractive offer and it is highly likely that we will end up buying the bundled products instead of just the original item.
								<br><br>
								So, we research the customer transactions and find out potential additions to the customer's original needs and offer it to the customer as a suggestion in the hope and intent that they buy them benefiting both the customer as well as the retail establishment.
								<br><br>
								In this section, we explore association rule-mining, a powerful technique that can be used for cross selling, then we apply the concept of market basket analysis to our retail transactions dataset.	<br><br><br>
