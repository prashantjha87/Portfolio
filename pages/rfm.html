								<p class="card-text">
								Nowadays where the industries are battling cutthroat competition to keep their target customer intact and establish a 
								new customer base, one of our clients wanted to adopt a strategic approach to market their business. <br> <br>	They faltered to find the right customer 
								base to market and sell their goods.<br><br>	We helped him to offer and intently analyze the buying habits of his target customers and discern what his 
								customers were looking to buy or what they would buy in the future, through thorough study and summarization of the charts and graphs of their 
								buying habits. This analysis technique gave them an edge over their competitors in the industry.

								<p class="card-text">
								Implementing RFM based customer segmentation
								We used our analytical techniques to identify the purchasing patterns through the customer segmentation model. <br>	<br>	Through this model, we focused on 
								categorizing the customers based on three key performance indicators, also known as KPI, mentioned below.<br><br>	
								1. Recency- It analyzes the freshness of a customer’s activities in terms of its purchase and visits.<br>								
								2. Frequency- which answers the question – how often does a customer purchase from your business?	<br>							
								3. The monetary indicator is the purchasing power of the customer.<br><br>																								
								Analyzing these factors helped our client to categorize his customer base into different segments. By understanding these factors, our client judiciously planned his marketing strategy to target his different customer segments. This empowered him to serve his customers with precisely what they are looking to buy, when they are looking to make a purchase and how he can convince customers to make a purchase.<br><br>										
								We helped our client to identify his customers and segregate them based on their purchasing activities. This allowed him to strategize his marketing activities and plan ways to revive the purchasing activities for each of the customer clusters. <br><br>		

								Based on the customers’ purchasing activity, we broadly categorized them into the following:RFM Customer Segmentation To perform RFM analysis, we divide customers into four equal groups according to the distribution of values for recency, frequency, and monetary value.<br>	

								Four equal groups across three variables create 64 (4x4x4) different customer segments.
